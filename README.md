# Billing System with Offers and Discounts Engine

A Java implementation of a checkout and billing system with support for various discount types, commonly used in retail and e-commerce applications.

## üìù Description

This system manages a catalog of products, allows adding/removing items from a shopping cart, applies various discount rules, supports undo functionality, and generates detailed receipts. It demonstrates core data structure concepts like HashMaps, Stacks, and Sorting algorithms.

## üéØ Features

### Product Catalog Management
- Store products with ID, name, price, and discount rules
- Fast lookup using HashMap data structure

### Shopping Cart Operations
- Add products to cart with specified quantities
- Remove products from cart
- Undo last cart operation using Stack data structure
- Clear entire cart

### Discount Engine
- **Item-Level Discounts**:
  - Buy-One-Get-One (BOGO)
  - Percentage discounts (e.g., 20% off)
- **Cart-Level Discounts**:
  - Automatic percentage off when cart total exceeds threshold

### Receipt Generation
- Detailed line items with product details and applied discounts
- Sort items by name, quantity, or price
- Cart subtotal, discounts, and final total calculation

## üß† Data Structures & Algorithms

- **HashMap**: For product catalog and cart item storage
- **Stack**: For implementing undo operations
- **Sorting**: Custom comparators for receipt item sorting
- **Searching**: Product lookup by ID

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Git (optional, for version control)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository (or download ZIP):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/billing-discounts-java.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd billing-discounts-java
   ```

### Running the Application

#### From Command Line:

1. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```
   java Main
   ```

#### Using IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Right-click on `Main.java`
3. Select "Run 'Main.main()'"

## üìã Usage

The application provides a simple command-line interface:

1. **Adding Products**: Select option 1, then enter product ID and quantity
2. **Removing Products**: Select option 2, then enter product ID and quantity
3. **Viewing Cart**: Select option 3 to see current cart contents
4. **Undo Last Action**: Select option 4 to revert the last cart operation
5. **Generate Receipt**: Select option 5 to create a formatted receipt (with sorting options)
6. **Clear Cart**: Select option 6 to remove all items from cart

### Sample Product Catalog

| ID   | Name       | Price | Discount     |
|------|------------|-------|-------------|
